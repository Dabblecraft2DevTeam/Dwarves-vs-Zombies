# For now this is only an idea collection in form of
# a configuration for the default dvz game

# when I want to make dwarves/zombies into one class system
# it would be best to merge monsters into dwarves
# things missing in dwarf system:
# - disguise
# - placeBlocks
# plus effectsystem ofcourse

# commands:
# win [team]
# lose [team]
# release [team]
# starttimer [timer]
# setstartteam [team]
# addstartteam [team]
# removestartteam [team]
# set [team] [invulnerable] [true/false]
# assassins [team] [percentage_of_players]
